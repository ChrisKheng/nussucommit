Creation is a digital design competition and is a new initiative organized by NUSSU Committee of Information and Technology (NUSSU commIT), the IT wing of the National University of Singapore Students' Union (NUSSU).

Creation hopes to encourage and bring out the creativity of NUS students, thus our tagline: “Imagine. Design. Create”. Our committee hope that we can provide the platform for NUS students to pursue their artistic passion: to imagine, to design and to create excellent pieces of digital artwork.

## What's on this year?

This year, we are collaborating with NUS offices to set up problem statements for participants to design. The problem statements can be in the form of designing posters, seasonal greetings, t-shirt design, and other publicity collaterals. Additionally, we will organize a photoshop training workshop to help you hone your skills before the competition itself. You could win attractive prizes too!
