### Microsoft Excel VBA

Macros allow users to record a set of actions in Microsoft Excel and repeating them dynamically on any cell or sheet. But have you ever wondered what does on behind recording a macro in Microsoft Excel?

Upon opening up your macro, you’ll find yourself exposed to the world of Visual Basics for Applications (VBA). VBA is the main programming language used in various Microsoft Office applications such as Word and Excel. It allows users to create and program custom scripts that can be executed through the click of a button or even during the opening of a spreadsheet. Actions that could have never been carried out through basic software functions.

As such, many businesses make use of this powerful tool to create custom applications such as automating the generation of reports, creating custom forms and compiling copious amounts of data.

This semester, commIT is partnering with Arcadia Training to bring you a workshop on Visual Basics for Applications, specifically for Microsoft Excel.

A glimpse of the topics that will covered include:

*   Defining Variables
*   Creating Forms
*   Message Boxes/Alerts
*   Activecell usage
*   Conditional Statements

…and more!

The workshop will be held at:
