### Outline of NUSSU commIT's Personal Data Protection Policy

Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (PDPA) of Singapore came into effect on July 2nd, 2014. PDPA establishes a data protection law that comprises various rules governing the collection, use, disclosure and care of personal data. It recognizes both the rights of individuals to protect their personal data and also the needs of organizations to collect, use or disclose personal data for legitimate and reasonable purposes.

As part of the compliance effort by National University of Singapore (NUS), a Compliance Guidelines, Policies and Processes was devised to deal with the PDPA. Those guidelines are enforced to all student organizations in NUS and are part of the student leaders’ obligations.

As a student organization which provides IT services to the NUS community, NUSSU commIT is of no exception. With the understanding that NUSSU commIT has its own unique operations and organisational complexities, NUSSU commIT Personal Data Protection Policy is crafted. It sets out how NUSSU commIT comply with the provisions of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (PDPA) of Singapore and NUS Compliance Guidelines and Policies. Through this, NUSSU commIT aims to address the concerns of their members and to maintain their trust in the personal data management by NUSSU commIT.

This policy will set out how NUSSU commIT manage their members’ Personal Data, the types of Personal Data to be collected, used, disclosed and/or retained, how and when NUSSU commIT collect, use, disclose and/or retain their members’ Personal Data, and the purpose(s) for which NUSSU commIT collect, use, disclose and/or retain their members’ Personal Data.
