We operate two separate computer clusters in NUS.
One in the best place to hangout in NUS, Yusof Ishak House (YIH), and another in AS8.

In YIH, we provide a total of 45 PCs in two clusters equipped with internet access, printing and scanning. To date, we are still the sole provider of public scanning services in NUS.

In AS8, we have more than 44 PCs there, with internet access and printing.

Other than being the IT services provider, we are also distinguished by our software training workshops which are of the highest of quality. Every semester, we provide training workshops on popular, on-demand softwares such as Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator and Excel Visual Basic Application (VBA).
